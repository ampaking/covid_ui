          Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the
          SARS-CoV-2 virus.

          Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate
          respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
          However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.
          Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like
          cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or
          cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick
          with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.&nbsp;

          The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well
          informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself
          and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from
          others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or
          using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your
          turn and follow local guidance.

          The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small
          liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.
          These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller
          aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for
          example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and
          self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.

        COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected
        people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without
        hospitalization.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms.&nbsp;
        Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their
        symptoms at home.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the
        virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.&nbsp;
